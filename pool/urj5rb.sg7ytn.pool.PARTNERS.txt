Thread Pool Assignment 


We (Sooren and Faruk) collaborated on the thread pool assignment equally, working together to ensure a successful implementation. 
Sooren was responsible for implementing essential parts of the ThreadPool class. 
He created the Worker method, which manages task execution and cleanup within the worker threads, and implemented the ThreadPool constructor,initializing the thread pool and starting worker threads. 
Additionally, we implemented the ThreadPool destructor, responsible for resource cleanup. 
Faruk mostly worked on the SubmitTask, WaitForTask, and stop methods in the ThreadPool class.
