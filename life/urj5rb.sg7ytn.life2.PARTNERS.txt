Game of Life


Sooren and I (Faruk) worked together to figure out why our threads were not running in parallel for this lab. We came up with a different approach where we used the given life-serial.cc as the blueprint to our thread_worker() function. This time, calculating different start rows and end rows for our loops and synchronizing the threads right in the thread_worker() instead of the simulate_life_parallel().

We then adjusted our simulate_life_parallel() function accordingly, making any minor tweaks necessary. Finally, we both tested and debugged the code to achieve matching results with the serial thread and improved efficiency with higher thread counts.
