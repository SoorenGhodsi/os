Shell Assignment Part 2

We worked together to come up with the pipeline method that handles pipe commands. Mehmet worked on the set up for the execute_pipeline() function and handled the initial test cases. Sooren worked on the debugging for the remaining test cases and implementing the remaining functionalities. 

We met a couple of times online to brainstorm and go over how to come up with the solution.
