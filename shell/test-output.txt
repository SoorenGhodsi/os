Could not run incompatible test "redirect stdin inode" (try on a different machine)
Test input:
  /usr/bin/stat -L -c %i/%d /proc/self/fd/0 < test/input.txt
  exit
Expected stdout regular expression pattern:
  <function <lambda> at 0x100c745e0>

Expected stderr regular expression pattern:
  <empty>
Errors:
  Test case could not be run since it is not compatible with your system:
  Linux-specific /proc/self/fd not found and used internally by test





Could not run incompatible test "redirect input then use normal input" (try on a different machine)
Test input:

Errors:
  Test case could not be run since it is not compatible with your system:
  Linux-specific /proc/self/fd not found and used internally by test and/or no version of "dd" with "status=none" support found (typical on OS X; try on a Linux machine instead)

  exit
Actual stdout:
  
Actual stderr:
  <error output not available>
Expected stdout regular expression pattern: (extra lines allowed)

Errors:
  timed out after 30 seconds
  in stdout: could not find match for pattern [.*1048576.*] in []
  in stderr: unexpected extra output [['<error output not available>']]



83 tests passed and 1 tests failed.
4 tests were not compatible with this machine. (Most likely, they require a Linux machine.)
---
Note on interpreting test output patterns:
All expected values matched against a "regular expression" where:
    .* means any string (including empty strings)
    .+ means any string (excluding empty strings)
    everything is matched case-insensitively
