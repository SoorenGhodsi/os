Shell Assignment Part 1

We equally worked to come up with the final version of the assignment. I helped to tokenize and pass the arguments. Sooren solved the issues regarding fork() and exec(). And we both worked together on the file redirection. 

We met 4 times to write the code and went to OHs to solve the issues behind the failed tests.
